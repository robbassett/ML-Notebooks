# Machine Learning Notebooks
This repository contains various notebooks created while learning about different types of machine learning, typically focused on some small projects.
The first two projects explore the basics of Q-learning, a technique in reinforcement learning:

[Basic Q-Learning employing a lookup Q-table](/RL/Basic_Q/FrozenLake.ipynb)

[Deep Q-Learning with Keras focused on the OpenAI Gym CartPole Environment](/RL/Deep_Q/CartPole.ipynb)

The next project gives an overview of predictive modeling using the random forest technique with XGBoost. Here I try to predict the winners of Australian Rules Football matches based on data collected from previous seasons:

[AFL Prediction with XGBoost](/AFL/AFL_prediction.ipynb)

Shown here is a demonstration of a very simple ML algorithm, K-means clustering. This notebook outlines the use of K-means clustering in image compression where it is used to reduce the number of colors used to render a given image:
