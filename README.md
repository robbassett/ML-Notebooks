# Machine Learning Notebooks
This repository contains various notebooks created while learning about different types of machine learning, typically focused on some small projects.
Currently, two notebooks are featured exploring the basics of Q-learning, a technique in reinforcement learning:

(Basic Q-Learning employing a lookup Q-table)[https://github.com/robbassett/ML-Notebooks/blob/master/RL/Basic_Q/FrozenLake.ipynb]

(Deep Q-Learning with Keras focused on the OpenAI Gym CartPole Environment)[https://github.com/robbassett/ML-Notebooks/blob/master/RL/Deep_Q/CartPole.ipynb]

This repo is a work in progress with more coming including some basics such as random forest predictions with XGBoost and 
image compression using KMeans Clustering.
